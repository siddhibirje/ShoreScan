# ShoreScan

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
**ShoreScan** is an AI and GIS-powered platform designed to monitor and analyze coastal erosion and plastic waste accumulation along Mumbaiâ€™s shoreline. The system leverages geospatial data, remote sensing, and deep learning to provide real-time insights and support sustainable coastal management.

Mumbai's coastal regions face two major environmental challenges:
- **Coastal Erosion**: Nearly 40% of Mumbaiâ€™s coastline is eroding due to wave action, tidal currents, and rising sea levels.
- **Plastic Waste Accumulation**: Over 2,100 tons of plastic waste are generated daily, with a significant portion ending up in the sea.

ShoreScan aims to address these issues by providing **data-driven solutions** for policymakers, researchers, and environmental organizations.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Uses **Google Earth Engine (GEE), QGIS, and ArcGIS** for real-time shoreline change tracking.
- **AI-Based Image Processing**: **Deep Learning (CNNs, YOLO, OpenCV)** to detect plastic waste from satellite/drone imagery.
- **Data Visualization**: **Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib** for interactive graphs and heatmaps.
- **Community Engagement**: Gamification features to encourage citizen participation in reporting and cleanup efforts.
- **Predictive Models**: Forecasts erosion trends using **machine learning algorithms**.
- **Decision Support System**: Generates reports for policymakers on coastal conservation strategies.
